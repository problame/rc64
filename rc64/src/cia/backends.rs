    ///
    /// In order to read the individual keys in the matrix, you must first set Port A for all outputs
    /// (255, $FF), and Port B for all inputs (0), using the Data Direction Registers.  Note that this
    /// is the default condition.  Next, you must write a 0 in the bit of Data Port A that corresponds

    ///
    /// A 0 in any bit position signifies that the key in the corresponding row of the selected column
    /// is being pressed, while a 1 indicates that the key is not being pressed.  A value of 255 ($FF)
    /// means that no keys in that column are being pressed.
    ///
    /// Fortunately for us all, an interrupt routine causes the keyboard to be read, and the results are
    /// made available to the Operating System automatically every 1/60 second.  And even when the
    /// normal interrupt routine cannot be used, you can use the Kernal SCNKEY routine at 65439 ($FF9F)
    /// to read the keyboard.
    ///
    /// These same data ports are also used to read the joystick controllers.  Although common sense
    /// might lead you to believe that you could read the joystick that is plugged into the port marked
    /// Controller Port 1 from Data Port A, and the second joystick from Data Port B, there is nothing
    /// common about the Commodore 64.  Controller Port 1 is read from Data Port B, and Controller Port
    /// 2 is read from CIA #1 Data Port A.
    ///
    /// Joysticks consist of five switches, one each for up, down, right, and left directions, and
    /// another for the fire button.  The switches are read like the key switches--if the switch is
    /// pressed, the corresponding bit will read 0, and if it is not pressed, the bit will be set to 1.
    /// From BASIC, you can PEEK the ports and use the AND and NOT operators to mask the unused bits and
    /// inverse the logic for easier comprehension.  For example, to read the joystick in Controller
    /// Port 1, you could use the statement:
    ///
    /// S1=NOT PEEK(56321)AND15
    ///
    /// The meaning of the possible numbers returned are:
    ///
    ///  0 = none pressed
    ///  1 = up
    ///  2 = down
    ///  4 = left
    ///  5 = up left
    ///  6 = down left
    ///  8 = right
    ///  9 = up right
    /// 10 = down right
    ///
    /// The same technique can be used for joystick 2, by substituting 56320 as the number to PEEK.  By
    /// the way, the 3 and 7 aren't listed because they represent impossible combinations like up-down.
    ///
    /// To read the fire buttons, you can PEEK the appropriate port and use the AND operator to mask all
    /// but bit 4:
    ///
    /// T1=(PEEK(56321)AND16)/16
    ///
    /// The above will return a 0 if the button is pressed, and a 1 if it is not.  Substitute location
    /// 56320 as the location to PEEK for Trigger Button 2.
    ///
    /// Since CIA #1 Data Port B is used for reading the keyboard as well as joystick 1, some confusion
    /// can result.  The routine that checks the keyboard has no way of telling whether a particular bit
    /// was set to 0 by a keypress or one of the joystick switches.  For example, if you plug the
    /// joystick into Controller Port 1 and push the stick to the right, the routine will interpret this
    /// as the 2 key being pressed, because both set the same bit to 0.  Likewise, when you read the
    /// joystick, it will register as being pushed to the right if the 2 key is being pressed.
    ///
    /// The problem of mistaking the keyboard for the joystick can be solved by turning off the keyscan
    /// momentarily when reading the stick with a POKE 56333, 127:POKE 56320,255, and restoring it after
    /// the read with a POKE 56333,129.  Sometimes you can use the simpler solution of clearing the
    /// keyboard buffer after reading the joystick, with a POKE 198,0.
    ///
    /// The problem of mistaking the joystick for a keypress is much more difficult--there is no real
    /// way to turn off the joystick.  Many commercially available games just use Controller Port 2 to
    /// avoid the conflict.  So, if you can't beat them, sit back and press your joystick to the left in
    /// order to slow down a program listing (the keyscan routine thinks that it is the CTRL key).
    ///
    /// As if all of the above were not enough, Port A is also used to control which set of paddles is
    /// read by the SID chip, and to read the paddle fire buttons.  Since there are two paddles per
    /// joystick Controller Port, and only two SID registers for reading paddle positions, there has to
    /// be a method for switching the paddle read from joystick Port 1 to joystick Port 2.
    ///
    /// When Bit 7 of Port A is set to 1 and Bit 6 is cleared to 0, the SID registers will read the
    /// paddles on Port 1.  When Bit 7 is set to 0 and Bit 6 is set to 1, the paddles on Port 2 are read
    /// by the SID chip registers.  Note that this also conflicts with the keyscan routine, which is
    /// constantly writing different values to CIA #1 Data Port A in order to select the keyboard column
    /// to read (most of the time, the value for the last column is written to this port, which
    /// coincides with the selection of paddles on joystick Port 1).  Therefore, in order to get an
    /// accurate reading, you must turn off the keyscan IRQ and select which joystick port you want to
    /// read.  See POTX at 54297 ($D419), which is the SID register where the paddles are read, for the
    /// exact technique.
    ///
    /// Although the SID chip is used to read the paddle settings, the fire buttons are read at CIA #1
    /// Data Ports A and B.  The fire buttons for the paddles plugged into Controller Port 1 are read at
    /// Data Port B (56321, $DC01), while those for the paddles plugged into Controller Port 2 are read
    /// from Data Port A (56320, $DC00).  The fire buttons are read at Bit 2 and Bit 3 of each port (the
    /// same as the joystick left and joystick right switches), and as usual, the bit will read 0 if the
    /// corresponding button is pushed, and 1 if it is not.
    ///
    /// Although only two of the rout paddle values can be read at any one time, you can always read all
    /// four paddle buttons.  See the game paddle input description at 54297 ($D419) for the BASIC
    /// statements used to read these buttons.
    ///
    /// Finally, Data Port B can also be used as an output by either Timer A or B.  It is possible to
    /// set a mode in which the timers do not cause an interrupt when they run down (see the
    /// descriptions of Control Registers A and B at 56334-5 ($DC0E-F)).  Instead, they cause the output
    /// on Bit 6 or 7 of Data Port B to change.  Timer A can be set either to pulse the output of Bit 6
    /// for one machine cycle, or to toggle that bit from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1.  Timer B can use Bit 7 of

    ///   BE 0-3
    ///
    /// 3.  Set the VIC-II register for character memory.  As explained at the

    ///
    /// POKE 53272,(PEEK(53272) AND 240) OR TK: REM TK IS 2 KBYTE OFFSET FROM
    ///   BEGINNING OF BLOCK
    ///

    /// POKE 53272,(PEEK(53272) AND 15) OR K*16: REM K IS KBYTE OFFSET FROM
    ///   BEGINNING OF BLOCK
    ///
    /// Since steps 3 and 4 operate on the same register, you could combine
    /// these steps and just POKE 53272,(16*K+TK).
    ///
    /// 5.  Set the Operating System pointer for display memory at 648 ($288).
    /// Even though you have just told the VIC-II chip where to display memory
    /// for the screen, the Operating System does not yet know where to write
    /// its text characters.  Let it know with this statement:
    ///
    /// POKE 648,AD/256: REM AD IS THE ACTUAL ADDRESS OF SCREEN MEMORY
    ///
    /// After you make this change, you must watch out for the STOP/RESTORE
    /// key combination.  The BRK initialization changes the screen display
    /// default to location 1024 in Bank 0, but not the Operating System
    /// pointer at 648 ($288).  As a result, what you are typing will not be
    /// displayed on the screen.  The computer will lock up until you turn the

/// Time of Day Clock (TOD)
///
/// In addition to the two general-purpose timers, the 6526 CIA chip has a special-purpose Time of
/// Day Clock, which keeps time in a format that humans can understand a little more easily than
/// microseconds.
///
/// This Time of Day Clock even has an alarm, which can cause an interrupt at a specific time.  It
/// is organized in four registers, one each for hours, minutes, seconds, and tenths of seconds.
/// Each register reads out in Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) format, for easier conversion to ASCII
/// digits.  A BCD byte is divided into two nybbles, each of which represents a single digit in base
/// 10.  Even though a four-bit nybble can hold a number from 0 to 15, only the base 10 digits of
/// 0-9 are used.  Therefore, 10 0'clock would be represented by a byte in the hours register with
/// the nybbles 0001 and 0000, which stand for the digits 1 and 0.  The binary value of this byte
/// would be 16 (16 times the high nybble plus the low nybble).  Each of the other registers
/// operates in the same manner.  In addition, Bit 7 of the hours register is used as an AM/PM flag.
/// If that bit is set to 1, it indicates PM, and if it is set to 0, the time is AM.
///
/// The Time of Day Clock Registers can be used for two purposes, depending on whether you are
/// reading them or writing to them.  If you are reading them, you will always be reading the time.
/// There is a latching feature associated with reading the hours register in order to solve the
/// problem of the time changing while you are reading the registers.  For example, if you were
/// reading the hours register just as the time was changing from 10:59 to 11:00, it is possible
/// that you would read the 10 in the hours register, and by the time you read the minutes register
/// it would have changed from 59 to 00.  Therefore, you would read 10:00 instead of either 10:59 or
/// 11:00.
///
/// To prevent this kind of mistake, the Time of Day Clock Registers stop updating as soon as you
/// read the hours register, and do not start again until you read the tenths of seconds register.
/// Of course, the clock continues to keep time internally even though it does not update the
/// registers.  If you want to read only minutes, or seconds or tenths of seconds, there is no
/// problem, and no latching will occur.  But anytime you read hours, you must follow it by reading
/// tenths of seconds, even if you don't care about them, or else the registers will not continue to
/// update.
///
/// Writing to these registers either sets the time or the alarm, depending on the setting of Bit 7
/// of Control Register B (56335, $DC0F).  If that bit is set to 1, writing to the Time of Day
/// registers sets the alarm.  If the bit is set to 0, writing to the Time of Day registers sets the
/// Time of Day clock.  In either case, as with reading the registers, there is a latch function.
/// This function stops the clock from updating when you write to the hours register.  The clock
/// will not start again until you write to the tenths of seconds registers.
///
/// The only apparent use of the Time of Day Clock by the 64's Operating System is in the BASIC RND
/// statement.  There, the seconds and tenths of seconds registers are read and their values used as
/// part of the seed value for the RND(0) command.
///
/// Nonetheless, this clock can be an invaluable resource for the 64 user.  It will keep time more
/// accurately than the software clock maintained at locations 60-162 ($A0-$A2) by the Timer A
/// interrupt routine.  And unlike that software clock, the Time of Day Clock will not be disturbed
/// when I/O operations disrupt the Timer A IRQ, or when the IRQ vector is diverted elsewhere.  Not
/// even a cold start RESET will disrupt the time.  For game timers, just set the time for
/// 00:00:00:0 and it will keep track of elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds and tenths of
/// seconds format.
///
/// The following digital clock program, written in BASIC, will demonstrate the use of these timers:
///

/// bit at a time, with the most significant bit (Bit 7) being transferred first.  Control Register
/// A at 56334 ($DC0E) allows you to choose input or output modes.  In input mode, a bit of data is

/// to let you know that it is time for a read.  After eight bits are received this way, the data is
/// placed in the Serial Port Register, and an interrupt is generated to let you know that the
/// register should be read.
///
/// In output mode, you write data to the Serial Port Register, and it is sent out over the SP line
/// (pin 5 of the User Port), using Timer A for the baud rate generator.  Whenever a byte of data is
/// written to this register, transmission will start as long as Timer A is running and in

/// are Timer A, Timer B, the Time of Day Clock, the Serial Register, and the FLAG line.  Timers A
/// and B cause an interrupt when they count down to 0.  The Time of Day Clock generates an
/// interrupt when it reaches the ALARM time.  The Serial Shift Register interrupts when it compiles
/// eight bits of input or output.  An external signal pulling the CIA hardware line called FLAG low
/// will also cause an interrupt (on CIA #1, this FLAG line is connected to the Cassette Read line
/// of the Cassette Port).
///
/// Even if the condition for a particular interrupt is satisfied, the interrupt must still be
/// enabled for an IRQ actually to occur.  This is done by writing to the Interrupt Control
/// Register.  What happens when you write to this register depends on the way that you set Bit 7.
/// If you set it to 0, any other bit that was written to with a 1 will be cleared, and the
/// corresponding interrupt will be disabled.  If you set Bit 7 to 1, any bit written to with a 1
/// will be set, and the corresponding interrupt will be enabled.  In either case, the interrupt
/// enable flags for those bits written to with a 0 will not be affected.
///
/// For example, in order to disable all interrupts from BASIC, you could POKE 56333, 127.  This
/// sets Bit 7 to 0, which clears all of the other bits, since they are all written with 1's.  Don't
/// try this from BASIC immediate mode, as it will turn off Timer A which causes the IRQ for reading
/// the keyboard, so that it will in effect turn off the keyboard.
///
/// To turn on the Timer A interrupt, a program could POKE 56333,129.  Bit 7 is set to 1 and so is
/// Bit 0, so the interrupt which corresponds to Bit 0 (Timer A) is enabled.
///
/// When you read this register, you can tell if any of the conditions for a CIA Interrupt were
/// satisfied because the corresponding bit will be set to a 1.  For example, if Timer A counts down
/// to 0, Bit 0 of this register will be set to 1.  If, in addition, the mask bit that corresponds
/// to that interrupt source is set to 1, and an interrupt occurs, Bit 7 will also be set.  This
/// allows a multi-interrupt system to read one bit and see if the source of a particular interrupt
/// was CIA #1.  You should note, however, that reading this register clears it, so you should
/// preserve its contents in RAM if you want to test more than one bit.
